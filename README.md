# 🌱 Groot – A Lightweight Git-like Version Control System

> “I am Groot!” – A custom version control system inspired by Git, built entirely in **Node.js**.

Groot is a minimal yet functional version control system that allows you to `init`, `add`, `commit`, view `log`s, and even see `diff`s between commits — all without using Git. It operates using its own `.groot` directory to manage files, commits, and content snapshots.
